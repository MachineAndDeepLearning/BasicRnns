# Basic Recurrent Neural Nets

This project implements a variety of simple recurrent neural models for the following problem domains
* Wikipedia
	* Needs the data from [Here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org)
* Edgar Alan Poe and Robert Frost poems

It also implements some basic functions for RNNs
* LSTM
* GRU
* Rated units
